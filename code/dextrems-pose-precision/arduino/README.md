### motor_osc_serial

This Arduino sketch should be used for controlling the exo. Note that to use it with this repo's python script, a jumper needs to be place correctly on the Arduino board (refer to the sketch). This will allow to only control the ring finger's MCP brake.

The OSC component can be discarded.
